**Brain Tumor Segmentation from MRI Scans Using Deep Learning**

***Project Overview***

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to automatically segment brain tumors from MRI scans. The model identifies the exact tumor region by generating a pixel-wise segmentation mask using a U-Net architecture.

Students will learn how to process medical imaging data, work with NIfTI files, build deep learning models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.
